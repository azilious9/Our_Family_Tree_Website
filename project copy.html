            <li>Mohammad Gulab was born in 1821 in Baghard, India. His field of work was in the iron industry.  He lived in and constructed his home in Jhunjhuroo. He married a woman in Narnol who's family name was coincidentally also Gulab. His in-laws used to say poetry about him that goes: `Gulab ki beti Gulab se hi biyaahi, Gulab sasur aur Gulab hi jawaien.` Translation: `Gulab married the daughter of Gulab, Gulab is the Father-in-Law and Gulab is the Son-in-law.` During the War of 1857 they moved to Narnol, however they still kept their property in Jhunjhuroo.  Gulab was an expert in making weapons such as swords and cannons. One of his swords was given to his grandson Mohammad Yaqoob as a family heirloom. One of his cannons is currently in the Lahore Shahi Qila Fort. He moved to Hyderabad Dakan with his son Haydar and they made weapons there together.</li>
